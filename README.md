#### DBpedia Spotlight Description

DBpedia Spotlight is a tool for automatically annotating mentions of DBpedia resources in text, providing a solution for linking unstructured information sources to the Linked Open Data cloud through DBpedia. DBpedia Spotlight recognizes that names of concepts or entities have been mentioned (e.g. "Michael Jordan"), and subsequently matches these names to unique identifiers (e.g. [dbpedia:Michael_I._Jordan](http://dbpedia.org/page/Michael_I._Jordan), the machine learning professor or [dbpedia:Michael_Jordan](http://dbpedia.org/page/Michael_Jordan) the basketball player). It can also be used for building your solution for [Named Entity Recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_entity_recognition), Keyphrase Extraction, Tagging, etc. amongst other information extraction tasks.
